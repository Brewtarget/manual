# User Manual
This repository is home to the user manual of [Brewtarget](http://www.brewtarget.org/). It is managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/Brewtarget/brewtarget) and published on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/brewtarget/user-manual) giving anyone the ability to easily suggest modifications, correct typos, or write a translation.

## Contributions
It is important when thinking about making a contribution to have a clear intent. Identify the areas and sections you wish to modify, and keep your changes limited and focused.

Before changing anything, you will need to have a GitHub account and fork the `Brewtarget/user-manual` repository. It is on this fork that you will apply your modifications, and make the pull request.

Once you are satified with your changes, check for spelling/grammar mistake. Verify the scope of your modification, and create a pull request on the main `Brewtarget/user-manual` repository.

## Gold Standard
This manual is meant to be translated in multiple locales. In order for the different versions not to look dissimilar, the `en` locale was chosen as the _Gold Standard_ of all the user manuals. This implies that other locales should aim to follow both the structure and format of the _Gold Standard_. Any major contributions, additions, and rewrites need to first be proposed on the `en` locale, and then translated.

This book is designed to be built using the Gitbook web infrastructure. From their website, you may read :

> GitBook was created mid 2014 with the vision of creating a modern and simple solution to documentation, digital writing and publishing. We've started by building an open source format. The philosophy is to be simple to the point of elegance, removing distractions and concerns from content creators, so that they can write freely.

One of the advantages of the GitBook Integrated Development Environment is that it offers horizontal integration of the whole process from editing to publishing. It also makes use of a simple syntax which easily be understood by newcomers.
